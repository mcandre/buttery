# buttery: a video editor with motion smoothing

![examples/homer.buttery.gif](examples/homer.buttery.gif)

# ABOUT

`buttery` generates continuous GIF loops.

# EXAMPLE

```console
$ buttery -in homer.gif
```

## Features

`-trimStart` / `-trimEnd` drop frames from the far sides of the input animation sequence.

* Trimming animations reduces file size.
* Trimming highlights your favorite motions.
* Trimming also helps to smooth over awkward motions at the start, middle, or end of an animation.
* Trimming can generate unique motion effects, by gluing together animation loops with unexpected timings.

See `buttery -help` for more information.
