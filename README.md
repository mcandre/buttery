# buttery: a video editor for smoother GIF loops

![examples/homer.buttery.gif](examples/homer.buttery.gif)

# ABOUT

The popular [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) format has *technically* supported animation loops for a long time. However, many GIF creators do not take full advantage of the format's capabilities. `buttery` helps to edit GIF files into smoother animation sequences.

Common GIF animation quirks may include:

* Single frame sequence
* Long sequences
* Animation halts after a few seconds
* Jerky motion

Enter `buttery`. With `buttery`, we can resolve many of these issues by programmable edits. We want to give artists more power to create and showcase their craft!

# EXAMPLE

```console
$ cd examples

$ buttery -in homer.gif

$ ls
homer.gif
homer.buttery.gif
```

## Common options

`-trimStart` / `-trimEnd` can drop frames from sides of the input GIF sequence. Trimming is useful for cutting down long animations to a specific subsequence. Trimming may facilitate motion smoothing. When used artfully, trimming can even generate unique motion.

See `buttery -help` for more information.
